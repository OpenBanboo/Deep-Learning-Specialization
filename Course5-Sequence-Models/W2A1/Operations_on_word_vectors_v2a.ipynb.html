# # Operations on Word Vectors
# 
# Welcome to your first assignment of Week 2, Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization! 
# 
# Because word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train, most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings. In this notebook you'll try your hand at loading, measuring similarity between, and modifying pre-trained embeddings. 
# 
# **After this assignment you'll be able to**:
# 
# * Explain how word embeddings capture relationships between words
# * Load pre-trained word vectors
# * Measure similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity
# * Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to ______.  
# 
# At the end of this notebook you'll have a chance to try an optional exercise, where you'll modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias. Reducing bias is an important consideration in ML, so you're encouraged to take this challenge!

# ## 1 - Load the Word Vectors
# 
# For this assignment, you'll use 50-dimensional GloVe vectors to represent words. 
# Run the following cell to load the `word_to_vec_map`. 

# In[2]:


words, word_to_vec_map = read_glove_vecs('data/glove.6B.50d.txt')


# You've loaded:
# - `words`: set of words in the vocabulary.
# - `word_to_vec_map`: dictionary mapping words to their GloVe vector representation.
# 
# <a name='2'></a>
# ## 2 - Embedding Vectors Versus One-Hot Vectors
# Recall from the lesson videos that one-hot vectors don't do a good job of capturing the level of similarity between words. This is because every one-hot vector has the same Euclidean distance from any other one-hot vector.
# 
# Embedding vectors, such as GloVe vectors, provide much more useful information about the meaning of individual words.  
# Now, see how you can use GloVe vectors to measure the similarity between two words! 

# <a name='3'></a>
# ## 3 - Cosine Similarity
# 
# To measure the similarity between two words, you need a way to measure the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors for the two words. Given two vectors $u$ and $v$, cosine similarity is defined as follows: 
# 
# $$\text{CosineSimilarity(u, v)} = \frac {u \cdot v} {||u||_2 ||v||_2} = cos(\theta) \tag{1}$$
# 
# * $u \cdot v$ is the dot product (or inner product) of two vectors
# * $||u||_2$ is the norm (or length) of the vector $u$
# * $\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$. 
# * The cosine similarity depends on the angle between $u$ and $v$. 
#     * If $u$ and $v$ are very similar, their cosine similarity will be close to 1.
#     * If they are dissimilar, the cosine similarity will take a smaller value.

# ### Exercise 1 - cosine_similarity
# 
# Implement the function `cosine_similarity()` to evaluate the similarity between word vectors.
# 
# **Reminder**: The norm of $u$ is defined as $ ||u||_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i^2}$
# 
# #### Additional Hints
# * You may find [np.dot](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html), [np.sum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html), or [np.sqrt](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sqrt.html) useful depending upon the implementation that you choose.

# You've come to the end of the graded portion of the assignment. By now, you've: 
# 
# * Loaded some pre-trained word vectors
# * Measured the similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity
# * Used word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to __.
# 
# Cosine similarity is a relatively simple and intuitive, yet powerful, method you can use to capture nuanced relationships between words. These exercises should be helpful to you in explaining how it works, and applying it to your own projects!  

# <font color='blue'>
#     <b>What you should remember</b>:
# 
# - Cosine similarity is a good way to compare the similarity between pairs of word vectors.
#     - Note that L2 (Euclidean) distance also works.
# - For NLP applications, using a pre-trained set of word vectors is often a great way to get started. </font>

# <a name='5'></a>
# ## 5 - Debiasing Word Vectors (OPTIONAL/UNGRADED) 

# In the following exercise, you'll examine gender biases that can be reflected in a word embedding, and explore algorithms for reducing the bias. In addition to learning about the topic of debiasing, this exercise will also help hone your intuition about what word vectors are doing. This section involves a bit of linear algebra, though you can certainly complete it without being an expert! Go ahead and give it a shot. This portion of the notebook is optional and is not graded...so just have fun and explore.  
# 
# First, see how the GloVe word embeddings relate to gender. You'll begin by computing a vector $g = e_{woman}-e_{man}$, where $e_{woman}$ represents the word vector corresponding to the word *woman*, and $e_{man}$ corresponds to the word vector corresponding to the word *man*. The resulting vector $g$ roughly encodes the concept of "gender". 
# 
# You might get a more accurate representation if you compute $g_1 = e_{mother}-e_{father}$, $g_2 = e_{girl}-e_{boy}$, etc. and average over them, but just using $e_{woman}-e_{man}$ will give good enough results for now.
# 

# In[14]:


g = word_to_vec_map['woman'] - word_to_vec_map['man']
print(g)


# Now, consider the cosine similarity of different words with $g$. What does a positive value of similarity mean, versus a negative cosine similarity? 

# In[16]:


print ('List of names and their similarities with constructed vector:')

# girls and boys name
name_list = ['john', 'marie', 'sophie', 'ronaldo', 'priya', 'rahul', 'danielle', 'reza', 'katy', 'yasmin']

for w in name_list:
    print (w, cosine_similarity(word_to_vec_map[w], g))


# As you can see, female first names tend to have a positive cosine similarity with our constructed vector $g$, while male first names tend to have a negative cosine similarity. This is not surprising, and the result seems acceptable. 
# 
# Now try with some other words:

# In[17]:


print('Other words and their similarities:')
word_list = ['lipstick', 'guns', 'science', 'arts', 'literature', 'warrior','doctor', 'tree', 'receptionist', 
             'technology',  'fashion', 'teacher', 'engineer', 'pilot', 'computer', 'singer']
for w in word_list:
    print (w, cosine_similarity(word_to_vec_map[w], g))


# Do you notice anything surprising? It is astonishing how these results reflect certain unhealthy gender stereotypes. For example, we see “computer” is negative and is closer in value to male first names, while “literature” is positive and is closer to female first names. Ouch! 
# 
# You'll see below how to reduce the bias of these vectors, using an algorithm due to [Boliukbasi et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520). Note that some word pairs such as "actor"/"actress" or "grandmother"/"grandfather" should remain gender-specific, while other words such as "receptionist" or "technology" should be neutralized, i.e. not be gender-related. You'll have to treat these two types of words differently when debiasing.
# 
# <a name='5-1'></a>
# ### 5.1 - Neutralize Bias for Non-Gender Specific Words 
# 
# The figure below should help you visualize what neutralizing does. If you're using a 50-dimensional word embedding, the 50 dimensional space can be split into two parts: The bias-direction $g$, and the remaining 49 dimensions, which is called $g_{\perp}$ here. In linear algebra, we say that the 49-dimensional $g_{\perp}$ is perpendicular (or "orthogonal") to $g$, meaning it is at 90 degrees to $g$. The neutralization step takes a vector such as $e_{receptionist}$ and zeros out the component in the direction of $g$, giving us $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$. 
# 
# Even though $g_{\perp}$ is 49-dimensional, given the limitations of what you can draw on a 2D screen, it's illustrated using a 1-dimensional axis below. 
# 
# <img src="images/neutral.png" style="width:800px;height:300px;">
# <caption><center><font color='purple'><b>Figure 2</b>: The word vector for "receptionist" represented before and after applying the neutralize operation.</font> </center></caption>
# 
# <a name='ex-3'></a>
# ### Exercise 3 - neutralize
# 
# Implement `neutralize()` to remove the bias of words such as "receptionist" or "scientist."
# 
# Given an input embedding $e$, you can use the following formulas to compute $e^{debiased}$: 
# 
# $$e^{bias\_component} = \frac{e \cdot g}{||g||_2^2} * g\tag{2}$$
# $$e^{debiased} = e - e^{bias\_component}\tag{3}$$
# 
# If you are an expert in linear algebra, you may recognize $e^{bias\_component}$ as the projection of $e$ onto the direction $g$. If you're not an expert in linear algebra, don't worry about this. ;) 
# 
# <!-- 
# **Reminder**: a vector $u$ can be split into two parts: its projection over a vector-axis $v_B$ and its projection over the axis orthogonal to $v$:
# $$u = u_B + u_{\perp}$$
# where : $u_B = $ and $ u_{\perp} = u - u_B $

# ### 5.2 - Equalization Algorithm for Gender-Specific Words
# 
# Next, let's see how debiasing can also be applied to word pairs such as "actress" and "actor." Equalization is applied to pairs of words that you might want to have differ only through the gender property. As a concrete example, suppose that "actress" is closer to "babysit" than "actor." By applying neutralization to "babysit," you can reduce the gender stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that "actor" and "actress" are equidistant from "babysit." The equalization algorithm takes care of this. 
# 
# The key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair of words are equidistant from the 49-dimensional $g_\perp$. The equalization step also ensures that the two equalized steps are now the same distance from $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$, or from any other work that has been neutralized. Visually, this is how equalization works: 
# 
# <img src="images/equalize10.png" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
# 
# 
# The derivation of the linear algebra to do this is a bit more complex. (See Bolukbasi et al., 2016 in the References for details.) Here are the key equations: 
# 
# 
# $$ \mu = \frac{e_{w1} + e_{w2}}{2}\tag{4}$$ 
# 
# $$ \mu_{B} = \frac {\mu \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{5}$$ 
# 
# $$\mu_{\perp} = \mu - \mu_{B} \tag{6}$$
# 
# $$ e_{w1B} = \frac {e_{w1} \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{7}$$ 
# $$ e_{w2B} = \frac {e_{w2} \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{8}$$
# 
# 
# $$e_{w1B}^{corrected} = \sqrt{ |{1 - ||\mu_{\perp} ||^2_2} |} * \frac{e_{\text{w1B}} - \mu_B} {||(e_{w1} - \mu_{\perp}) - \mu_B||_2} \tag{9}$$
# 
# 
# $$e_{w2B}^{corrected} = \sqrt{ |{1 - ||\mu_{\perp} ||^2_2} |} * \frac{e_{\text{w2B}} - \mu_B} {||(e_{w2} - \mu_{\perp}) - \mu_B||_2} \tag{10}$$
# 
# $$e_1 = e_{w1B}^{corrected} + \mu_{\perp} \tag{11}$$
# $$e_2 = e_{w2B}^{corrected} + \mu_{\perp} \tag{12}$$

# Go ahead and play with the input words in the cell above, to apply equalization to other pairs of words. 
# 
# Hint: Try...
# 
# These debiasing algorithms are very helpful for reducing bias, but aren't perfect and don't eliminate all traces of bias. For example, one weakness of this implementation was that the bias direction $g$ was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and _man_. As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, you would obtain a better estimate of the "gender" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space. Feel free to play with these types of variants as well! 

# ### Congratulations!
# 
# You have come to the end of both graded and ungraded portions of this notebook, and have seen several of the ways that word vectors can be applied and  modified. Great work pushing your knowledge in the areas of neutralizing and equalizing word vectors! See you next time.
