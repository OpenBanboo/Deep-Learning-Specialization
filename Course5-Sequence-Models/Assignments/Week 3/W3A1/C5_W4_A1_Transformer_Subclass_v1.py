# # Transformer Network
# 
# Welcome to Week 4's assignment, the last assignment of Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization! And congratulations on making it to the last assignment of the entire Deep Learning Specialization - you're almost done!
# 
# Ealier in the course, you've implemented sequential neural networks such as RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs. In this notebook you'll explore the Transformer architecture, a neural network that takes advantage of parallel processing and allows you to substantially speed up the training process. 
# 
# **After this assignment you'll be able to**:
# 
# * Create positional encodings to capture sequential relationships in data
# * Calculate scaled dot-product self-attention with word embeddings
# * Implement masked multi-head attention
# * Build and train a Transformer model
# 
# For the last time, let's get started!

# ## 1 - Positional Encoding
# 
# In sequence to sequence tasks, the relative order of your data is extremely important to its meaning. When you were training sequential neural networks such as RNNs, you fed your inputs into the network in order. Information about the order of your data was automatically fed into your model.  However, when you train a Transformer network using multi-head attention, you feed your data into the model all at once. While this dramatically reduces training time, there is no information about the order of your data. This is where positional encoding is useful - you can specifically encode the positions of your inputs and pass them into the network using these sine and cosine formulas:
#     
# $$
# PE_{(pos, 2i)}= sin\left(\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\frac{2i}{d}}}\right)
# \tag{1}$$
# <br>
# $$
# PE_{(pos, 2i+1)}= cos\left(\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\frac{2i}{d}}}\right)
# \tag{2}$$
# 
# * $d$ is the dimension of the word embedding and positional encoding
# * $pos$ is the position of the word.
# * $i$ refers to each of the different dimensions of the positional encoding.
# 
# To develop some intuition about positional encodings, you can think of them broadly as a feature that contains the information about the relative positions of words. The sum of the positional encoding and word embedding is ultimately what is fed into the model. If you just hard code the positions in, say by adding a matrix of 1's or whole numbers to the word embedding, the semantic meaning is distorted. Conversely, the values of the sine and cosine equations are small enough (between -1 and 1) that when you add the positional encoding to a word embedding, the word embedding is not significantly distorted, and is instead enriched with positional information. Using a combination of these two equations helps your Transformer network attend to the relative positions of your input data. This was a short discussion on positional encodings, but develop further intuition, check out the *Positional Encoding Ungraded Lab*. 
# 
# **Note:** In the lectures Andrew uses vertical vectors, but in this assignment all vectors are horizontal. All matrix multiplications should be adjusted accordingly.

# ### 1.1 - Sine and Cosine Angles
# 
# Notice that even though the sine and cosine positional encoding equations take in different arguments (`2i` versus `2i+1`, or even versus odd numbers) the inner terms for both equations are the same: $$\theta(pos, i, d) = \frac{pos}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d}}} \tag{3}$$
# 
# Consider the inner term as you calculate the positional encoding for a word in a sequence.<br> 
# $PE_{(pos, 0)}= sin\left(\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\frac{0}{d}}}\right)$, since solving `2i = 0` gives `i = 0` <br>
# $PE_{(pos, 1)}= cos\left(\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\frac{0}{d}}}\right)$, since solving `2i + 1 = 1` gives `i = 0`
# 
# The angle is the same for both! The angles for $PE_{(pos, 2)}$ and $PE_{(pos, 3)}$ are the same as well, since for both, `i = 1` and therefore the inner term is $\left(\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\frac{1}{d}}}\right)$. This relationship holds true for all paired sine and cosine curves:

# ## 2 - Masking
# 
# There are two types of masks that are useful when building your Transformer network: the *padding mask* and the *look-ahead mask*. Both help the softmax computation give the appropriate weights to the words in your input sentence. 
# 
# <a name='2-1'></a>
# ### 2.1 - Padding Mask
# 
# Oftentimes your input sequence will exceed the maximum length of a sequence your network can process. Let's say the maximum length of your model is five, it is fed the following sequences:
# 
#     [["Do", "you", "know", "when", "Jane", "is", "going", "to", "visit", "Africa"], 
#      ["Jane", "visits", "Africa", "in", "September" ],
#      ["Exciting", "!"]
#     ]
# 
# which might get vectorized as:
# 
#     [[ 71, 121, 4, 56, 99, 2344, 345, 1284, 15],
#      [ 56, 1285, 15, 181, 545],
#      [ 87, 600]
#     ]
#     
# When passing sequences into a transformer model, it is important that they are of uniform length. You can achieve this by padding the sequence with zeros, and truncating sentences that exceed the maximum length of your model:
# 
#     [[ 71, 121, 4, 56, 99],
#      [ 2344, 345, 1284, 15, 0],
#      [ 56, 1285, 15, 181, 545],
#      [ 87, 600, 0, 0, 0],
#     ]
#     
# Sequences longer than the maximum length of five will be truncated, and zeros will be added to the truncated sequence to achieve uniform length. Similarly, for sequences shorter than the maximum length, they zeros will also be added for padding. However, these zeros will affect the softmax calculation - this is when a padding mask comes in handy! You will need to define a boolean mask that specifies which elements you must attend(1) and which elements you must ignore(0). Later you will use that mask to set all the zeros in the sequence to a value close to negative infinity (-1e9). We'll implement this for you so you can get to the fun of building the Transformer network! 😇 Just make sure you go through the code so you can correctly implement padding when building your model. 
# 
# After masking, your input should go from `[87, 600, 0, 0, 0]` to `[87, 600, -1e9, -1e9, -1e9]`, so that when you take the softmax, the zeros don't affect the score.
# 
# The [MultiheadAttention](https://keras.io/api/layers/attention_layers/multi_head_attention/) layer implemented in Keras, use this masking logic.

def create_padding_mask(decoder_token_ids):
    """

# If we multiply (1 - mask) by -1e9 and add it to the sample input sequences, the zeros are essentially set to negative infinity. Notice the difference when taking the softmax of the original sequence and the masked sequence:

print(tf.keras.activations.softmax(x))
print(tf.keras.activations.softmax(x + (1 - create_padding_mask(x)) * -1.0e9))


# <a name='2-2'></a>
# ### 2.2 - Look-ahead Mask
# 
# The look-ahead mask follows similar intuition. In training, you will have access to the complete correct output of your training example. The look-ahead mask helps your model pretend that it correctly predicted a part of the output and see if, *without looking ahead*, it can correctly predict the next output. 
# 
# For example, if the expected correct output is `[1, 2, 3]` and you wanted to see if given that the model correctly predicted the first value it could predict the second value, you would mask out the second and third values. So you would input the masked sequence `[1, -1e9, -1e9]` and see if it could generate `[1, 2, -1e9]`.
# 
# Just because you've worked so hard, we'll also implement this mask for you 😇😇. Again, take a close look at the code so you can effictively implement it later.

# ## 3 - Self-Attention

# <caption><center><font color='purple'><b>Figure 1: Self-Attention calculation visualization</font></center></caption>
#     
# The use of self-attention paired with traditional convolutional networks allows for the parallization which speeds up training. You will implement **scaled dot product attention** which takes in a query, key, value, and a mask as inputs to returns rich, attention-based vector representations of the words in your sequence. This type of self-attention can be mathematically expressed as:
# $$
# \text { Attention }(Q, K, V)=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{Q K^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}+{M}\right) V\tag{4}\
# $$
# 
# * $Q$ is the matrix of queries 
# * $K$ is the matrix of keys
# * $V$ is the matrix of values
# * $M$ is the optional mask you choose to apply 
# * ${d_k}$ is the dimension of the keys, which is used to scale everything down so the softmax doesn't explode
#

# ### Exercise 3 - scaled_dot_product_attention 
# 
#     Implement the function `scaled_dot_product_attention()` to create attention-based representations
# **Reminder**: The boolean mask parameter can be passed in as `none` or as either padding or look-ahead. Multiply (1. - mask) by -1e9 before applying the softmax.

# **Additional Hints**
# * You may find [tf.matmul](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/linalg/matmul) useful for matrix multiplication.

# Excellent work! You can now implement self-attention. With that, you can start building the encoder block! 

# <a name='4'></a>
# ## 4 - Encoder
# 
# The Transformer Encoder layer pairs self-attention and convolutional neural network style of processing to improve the speed of training and passes K and V matrices to the Decoder, which you'll build later in the assignment. In this section of the assignment, you will implement the Encoder by pairing multi-head attention and a feed forward neural network (Figure 2a). 
# <img src="encoder_layer.png" alt="Encoder" width="250"/>
# <caption><center><font color='purple'><b>Figure 2a: Transformer encoder layer</font></center></caption>
# 
# * `MultiHeadAttention` you can think of as computing the self-attention several times to detect different features. 
# * Feed forward neural network contains two Dense layers which we'll implement as the function `FullyConnected`
# 
# Your input sentence first passes through a *multi-head attention layer*, where the encoder looks at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. The outputs of the multi-head attention layer are then fed to a *feed forward neural network*. The exact same feed forward network is independently applied to each position.
#    
# * For the `MultiHeadAttention` layer, you will use the [Keras implementation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MultiHeadAttention). If you're curious about how to split the query matrix Q, key matrix K, and value matrix V into different heads, you can look through the implementation. 
# * You will also use the [Sequential API](https://keras.io/api/models/sequential/) with two dense layers to built the feed forward neural network layers.

# <a name='4-1'></a>
# ### 4.1 Encoder Layer
# 
# Now you can pair multi-head attention and feed forward neural network together in an encoder layer! You will also use residual connections and layer normalization to help speed up training (Figure 2a).
# 
# <a name='ex-4'></a>
# ### Exercise 4 - EncoderLayer
# 
# Implement `EncoderLayer()` using the `call()` method
# 
# In this exercise, you will implement one encoder block (Figure 2) using the `call()` method. The function should perform the following steps: 
# 1. You will pass the Q, V, K matrices and a boolean mask to a multi-head attention layer. Remember that to compute *self*-attention Q, V and K should be the same. Let the default values for `return_attention_scores` and `training`. You will also perform Dropout in this multi-head attention layer during training. 
# 2. Now add a skip connection by adding your original input `x` and the output of the your multi-head attention layer. 
# 3. After adding the skip connection, pass the output through the first normalization layer.
# 4. Finally, repeat steps 1-3 but with the feed forward neural network with a dropout layer instead of the multi-head attention layer. 
# 
# <details>
#   <summary><font size="2" color="darkgreen"><b>Additional Hints (Click to expand)</b></font></summary>
#     
# * The `__init__` method creates all the layers that will be accesed by the the `call` method. Wherever you want to use a layer defined inside  the `__init__`  method you will have to use the syntax `self.[insert layer name]`. 
# * You will find the documentation of [MultiHeadAttention](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MultiHeadAttention) helpful. *Note that if query, key and value are the same, then this function performs self-attention.*
# * The call arguments for `self.mha` are (Where B is for batch_size, T is for target sequence shapes, and S is output_shape):
#  - `query`: Query Tensor of shape (B, T, dim).
#  - `value`: Value Tensor of shape (B, S, dim).
#  - `key`: Optional key Tensor of shape (B, S, dim). If not given, will use value for both key and value, which is the most common case.
#  - `attention_mask`: a boolean mask of shape (B, T, S), that prevents attention to certain positions. The boolean mask specifies which query elements can attend to which key elements, 1 indicates attention and 0 indicates no attention. Broadcasting can happen for the missing batch dimensions and the head dimension.
#  - `return_attention_scores`: A boolean to indicate whether the output should be attention output if True, or (attention_output, attention_scores) if False. Defaults to False.
#  - `training`: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (no dropout). Defaults to either using the training mode of the parent layer/model, or False (inference) if there is no parent layer.

# ### 4.2 - Full Encoder
# 
# Awesome job! You have now successfully implemented positional encoding, self-attention, and an encoder layer - give yourself a pat on the back. Now you're ready to build the full Transformer Encoder (Figure 2b), where you will embedd your input and add the positional encodings you calculated. You will then feed your encoded embeddings to a stack of Encoder layers.

# ### Exercise 5 - Encoder
# 
# Complete the `Encoder()` function using the `call()` method to embed your input, add positional encoding, and implement multiple encoder layers 
# 
# In this exercise, you will initialize your Encoder with an Embedding layer, positional encoding, and multiple EncoderLayers. Your `call()` method will perform the following steps: 
# 1. Pass your input through the Embedding layer.
# 2. Scale your embedding by multiplying it by the square root of your embedding dimension. Remember to cast the embedding dimension to data type `tf.float32` before computing the square root.
# 3. Add the position encoding: self.pos_encoding `[:, :seq_len, :]` to your embedding.
# 4. Pass the encoded embedding through a dropout layer, remembering to use the `training` parameter to set the model training mode. 
# 5. Pass the output of the dropout layer through the stack of encoding layers using a for loop.

# 2. Block 2 will take into account the output of the Encoder, so the multi-head attention layer will receive K and V from the encoder, and Q from the Block 1. You will then apply a normalization layer and a residual connection, just like you did before with the `EncoderLayer`.
# 3. Finally, Block 3 is a feed forward neural network with dropout and normalization layers and a residual connection.

# ## Conclusion
# 
# You've come to the end of the graded portion of the assignment. By now, you've: 
# 
# * Create positional encodings to capture sequential relationships in data
# * Calculate scaled dot-product self-attention with word embeddings
# * Implement masked multi-head attention
# * Build and train a Transformer model

# <font color='blue'>
#     <b>What you should remember</b>:
# 
# - The combination of self-attention and convolutional network layers allows of parallization of training and *faster training*.
# - Self-attention is calculated using the generated query Q, key K, and value V matrices.
# - Adding positional encoding to word embeddings is an effective way of include sequence information in self-attention calculations. 
# - Multi-head attention can help detect multiple features in your sentence.
# - Masking stops the model from 'looking ahead' during training, or weighting zeroes too much when processing cropped sentences. 

# Now that you have completed the Transformer assignment, make sure you check out the ungraded labs to apply the Transformer model to practical use cases such as Name Entity Recogntion (NER) and Question Answering (QA).  
# 
# 
# # Congratulations on finishing the Deep Learning Specialization!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
# 
# This was the last graded assignment of the specialization. It is now time to celebrate all your hard work and dedication!
